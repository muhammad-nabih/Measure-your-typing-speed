# Fast Typing English Words Game

The Fast Typing English Words Game is a simple JavaScript project designed to improve English typing skills. The project allows users to select a difficulty level and a time duration and then prompts them to type the displayed words within the specified time.

## How the Project Works

- Users can select the difficulty level (Easy, Normal, Hard).
- The required words to be typed are displayed on the page.
- After clicking the "Start" button, a countdown begins, and users can start typing the words.
- After typing a word correctly, it is removed from the list, and users can continue typing the next word.
- The game ends when the timer reaches zero or when the user types all the words correctly.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:
- **HTML:** Contains the structure and layout of the game.
- **CSS:** Styles the user interface for a better user experience.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the game logic, including level selection, word filtering, word display, score tracking, and timer management.
